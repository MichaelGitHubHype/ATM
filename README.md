# Grade 12 ATM project

This is an ATM - Automated Teller Machine simulation. In this program similarly to an you will be able to create an account, 
log in, view account information, change pin number, withdraw money, deposit money, pay bills and view history. 
The nice thing about this program is that it uses text files to save your information even after you logged out which is 
similiar to what actual ATMs do using databases.
